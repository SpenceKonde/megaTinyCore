## Supported IDE versions
megaTinyCore requires a version of the IDE later than 1.6.3; - it may require a much more recent version of the IDE; this has not been tested. It has been tested with 1.8.9. 

## Boards Manager Installation - Not yet available

Board manager support for this core will be added shortly. When it is, it will be possible to install using the boards manager. The boards manager URL is:

`http://drazzy.com/package_drazzy.com_index.json`

1. File -> Preferences, enter the above URL in "Additional Boards Manager URLs"
2. Tools -> Boards -> Boards Manager...
3. Select "megaTinyCore by Spence Konde" and click "Install".

## Manual Installation
Manual installation allows the latest version of the core to be installed, with fixes that may not yet be available in the board manager version of the core. 

For a manual installation, the Official Arduino megaAVR board package must be installed using board manager!

For installing megaTinyCore, there are two options:

Option 1: Download the .zip, extract, and place in the hardware folder inside your sketchbook folder (if there is no hardware folder, create it). You can find/set the location of the sketchbook folder in the Arduino IDE at File > Preferences -> Sketchbook location.

Option 2: Download the github client, and sync this repo to the hardware subfolder of your sketchbook folder.
