/*  Both millis and micros must take great care to prevent any kind of backward time travel.
 *
 * These values are unsigned, and should not decrease, except when they overflow. Hence when
 * we compare a value with what we recorded previously and find the new value to be lower, it
 * looks the same as it would 2^32 (4.2 billion) intervals in the future. Timeouts end prematurely
 * and similar undesired behaviors occur.
 *
 * There are three hazardous things we read here:
 * timer_millis, timer_overflow_count, and the timer count itself (TCxn.CNT).
 * The normal variables need only be read with interrupts disabled, in case of an
 * interrupt writing to it while we were reading it. AVRs are little-endian, so this would result
 * in the low byte being read before the overflow and the high byte after, and hence a value
 * higher than it should be for that call. Subsequent calls would return the right value.
 *
 * In the case of the timer value, it is more complicated.
 * Here, the hardware at first glance seems to protect us (see "reading 16-bit registers" in the
 * datasheet). But the register gets read in the interrupt, so we still need those disabled.
 * There is an additional risk though that we get a value from after the timer has overflowed
 * and since we disabled interrupts, the interrupt hasn't updated the overflow. We check the
 * interrupt flag, and if it's set, we check whether the timer value we read was near overflow
 * (the specifics vary by the timer - they're very different timers). If it isn't close to overflow
 * but the flag is set, we must have read it after the overflow, so we compensate for the missed
 * interrupt. If interrupts are disabled for long enough, this heuristic will be wrong, but in
 * that case it is the user's fault, as this limitation is widely known and documentedm, as well
 * as unavoidable. Failure to compensate looks like the inverse of the above case.
 *
 * (note that only micros reads the timer, and hence, only micros can experience backwards time
 * travel due to interrupts being left disabled for too long, millis will just stop increasing.
 *
 * Both of these cause severe breakage everywhere. The first type is simple to avoid, but if
 * missed can be more subtle, since it makes a big difference only if the byte where the read
 * was interrupted rolled over. The second type is more obvious, potentially happening on every timer
 * overflow, instead of just every 256th timer overflow, and when it does happen, anything waiting
 * for a specific number of microseconds to pass that gets that value will do so.
 * Though (see delay below) each incidence only short-circuits one ms of delay(), not the whole
 * thing.
 *
 * All time time travel except for glitchs from disabling millis for too long should no longer
 * be possible. If they are, that is a critical bug.

      /* Ersatz Division for TCBs - now with inline assembly!
       *
       * It's well known that division is an operator you want to avoid like the plague on AVR.
       * Not only is it slow, the execution time isn't even easy to analyze - it depends on the
       * two opperands, particularly the divisor... so you can't just look at the generated
       * assembly and count clock cycles, you've got to either time it expoerimentally with
       * a representative set of sample data, or know how many times it will pass through the
       * loops and then count clock cycles. If the operands aren't constant (if they are, you
       * can probably manage to get it optimized away at compile time) your best hope is likely
       * simulation, assuming you know enough about the values it will end up having to divide.
       *
       * Anyway. You don't want to be doing division. But that's what you need in order to
       * appropriately scale the ick count from the prescaler-deprived TCBs. Since many users
       * reconfigure the TCA for advanced PWM, using the TCA-prescaled clock was a non-starter
       * particularly since many parts have only one TCA. But division can be approximated
       * very closely if the divisor is constant using a series of bitshifts and addition/subtraction.
       *
       * The series of shifts was determined numerically with a spreadsheet that calculated the results for
       * each value that could come from the initial round of rightshifts for any combination of
       * bitshifts and provided a number of statistics to select based on. Bacwards time travel must
       * never happenb, or if it does, it must be a shorter backward step than micros runtime - 1 us
       * otherwise delay() will break and timeouts can instantly expire when it is hit. Similarly,
       * one wants to avoid large jumps forward, and cases where more consecutive "actual" times
       * than absolutely necessary return the same value (time should flow at a constant rate).
       * Finally, the artifacts of the calculation that are unavoidable should be distributed uniformly.
       * Undershooting or overshooting 999 endpoint at the counter's maximum value is the usual
       * source of large jumps (at the overflow point) in either direction. Terms should, as much as
       * possible alternate between positive and negative to minimize artifacs.
       *
       * The most popular/important speeds are hand-implemented in assembly because the compiler
       * was doing a miserable job of it - wasting 20-30% of the execution time and it's one of the few
       * Arduino API functions that users will be surprised and dismayed to find running slowiy.
       * Not only does it run faster on "normal" boards (the 16 MHz clock eliminates the need to divide
       * DxCore offers many speeds where the math doesn't all optimize away to nothing like it does at
       * 1/2/4/8/16/32.
       *
       * Do notice that we are replacing a smaller number of terms, and it's still much faster
       * The 10's went from 5 term ersatz-division to 6, while 12's went from 5 terms to 9, yet still
       * got a lot faster. The terrible twelves are the frequency most difficult to do this with.
       * Ironically, one of the the two that are is easiest is 36, which is good enough with 3 and
       * effectively exact (That "middle 12" is closer than the other 12's get with 9!)
       * 25 also matches it. Maybe it's something 25 and 36 being perfect squares?
       *
       * The three problems were that:
       * 1. Compiler generated code stubbornly insisted doing repeated shift operation in a loop
       * with 3 cycle per iteration (the shift itself took only 2)
       * 2. Compiler could not be convinced to do things that we know will always be < 255 as
       * bytes. Sure, it wouldn't know that - it's not legal for it to do that on it's own.
       * But even when I cast everything to uint8_t, it would shift a 16-bit value around
       * unnecessarily.
       * 3. It would distribute the ticks >> 4. That is, it wouldn't shift the value of
       * ticks in place, even though it wasn't referenced after this because I was assigning
       * the result to ticks, and hence the old value was "dead"
       * Instead, it would copy it, shift the copy 3 or 4 places. Then when it needed the
       * ticks >> 2, it would make a copy of the ORIGINAL and shift that 6 places,
       * instead of copying the copy and shifting just 2 places.
       *
       * A general trend seems to be that the compiler is not smart enough to "reuse" an
       * existing value that has already been shifted such that it's closer to the target.
       * at least for multi-byte variables. This is not the worst example of it I've run into
       * but the micros() function is a little bit sensitive to the execution time.
       * Apparently people sometimes want to *do something* in response to the value it
       * returns - and they seem to want to do that in a timely manner, otherwise they'd
       * have not bothered to record a time so accurately...
       *
       * general algorithm in the assembly implementations is:
       * start with ticks in a register pair, copy to r0, r1.
       * rightshift it until we have the 0th term (closest power of 2).
       * copy it to back to original location..
       * continue rightshifting it, adding or subtracting from the original when we reach
       * the appropriate terms.
       * As soon as we've rightshifted the original enough times that we know it's < 256,
       * we switch from lsr r1 ror r0 to just lsr r0. At the next term that we want to add
       * we copy it to r1. Subsequent subtractions or additions are single-byte until we've got the last term.
       * this time, we add r1 to r0 instead of the other way around.
       * we will need to clear r1 anyway, but we do it now, since we need a known 0 to do the carry.
       * we addthat to the ticks intermediate value to get the final ticks value, and drop back into C
       * where we calculate overflows * 1000, the (now 0-999) ticks to it, and return it.

/* delay()
 * So what do you WANT in a good delay function?
 * First, obviously you want it to delay things. You do not want it to block interrupts (then a long one would throw off
 * timekeeping, miss inputs, and so on). And you want the compiled size to not be prohibitive for the part.
 * The reason it's so important wrt. interrupts is that in Arduino standard delay(), if an interrupt fires in the middle,
 * will still end at the same time - it is "interrupt insensitive". Whenever a delay is using the builtin _delay_ms()
 * if that is interrupted it has no way of knowing time has passed. Now hopefully you're not spending so much time in
 * an ISR that this is significant, but it is still undesirable.
 *
 * For the unfortunate souls using small-flash parts, the flash usage becomes a major problem - why is it such a space-hog?
 * Because it has to pull in micros(), which is bulky even with the division turned into bitshifts... RTC has same problem
 * with millis(), the conversion of 1024ths of a second to 1000ths is a killer, even with the bitshift tricks,
 * and the compiler seems really stupid about how it handles it; I can't keep it from making an extra copy of the 32-bit
 * value, which ALSO requires 4 more push and pop operations to get registers it can use.
 *
 * Now we will use one of three delay() implementations:
 * If you have 16k+ your delay is the standard one, it pulls in micros(), yes, but you may well already have grabbed
 *  that for your sketch already, and the delay is more accurate and fully interrupt insensitive, and you can afford
 *  the memory. For RTC users they will get the analogous implementation that is based on millis.
 * Users with millis disabled, or with less than 16k flash and using RTC will get the implementation based on _delay_ms().
 * Everyone else (flash under 16k but millis enabled via non-RTC timer) will get the light version which calls _delay_ms()
 *  if the delay is under 16 ms to get less flash usage, and calculates the delay using **millis** not micros otherwise,
 *  saving over 100b of flash. The reason for the split is that the limited granularity of millis introduces an error in
 *  the delay duration of up to 1ms. That doesn't matter much when you call delay(1000) on an internal clock that's within
 *  1% on a good day. It matters greatly when you call delay(1);    */

/* delayMicroseconds() when delay is not a compile-time known constant.
 * Delay for the given number of microseconds. This is UGLY AS SIN and explicitly depends on function call
 * overhead for very short delays.
 * High clock speeds shouldn't return immediately for a 1us delay - we can instead only drop a fraction of a us
 * 48, 44, 40, and 32 drop 1/2 us, and 36 drops 2/3rds.
 * Note that us ceases to be in units of microseconds as soon as the function is entered; it gets turned into the loop counter.
 * Then we use a minimal number of bitshifts to calculate the number of passes through the delay loop
 * and subtract the number of loop-cycles of time we burned doing so. But need to be careful that sane values
 * don't get so much bigger that they overflow the unsigned int we're storing it in. To that end, we use
 * a longer loop at faster clock speeds.
 * In the inline assembly, when a delay of 8 clocks or longer is required, we save flash with a clever trick:
 *  "rjmp .+2" "\n\t"     // 2 cycles - jump over the return.
 *  "ret" "\n\t"          // 4 cycles - rjmped over initially...
 *  "rcall .-4" "\n\t"    // 2 cycles - ... but then called here...
 * This exploits the fact that return is a 4-clock instruction (even on AVRxt) by first hopping over a return
 * then immediately calling that return instruction - 8 clocks in 3 words. Once the ret is there, additional
 * rcall instructions can get 6 clocks in a single word, though we only get to take advantage of that once for
 * the 30 MHz case and any longer delays do better with a loop.
