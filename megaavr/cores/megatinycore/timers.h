        Hey, we're not using the internal oscillator for the clock! We can totally run it at an ideal frequency from internal and use external for system clock!

        There are at least five ways to slice this that look nearly identical. These are virtually indistinguishable from each other giving PWM at 980 Hz.
        One runs the clock at 8 MHz with /32 division on the count prescaler and /1 on the synchronizer.
        Another method drops the count prescaler back to /4, and compensates by increasing the sync prescaler to /8
        A third way is to drop the count prescaler back to /4, sync prescale to /1, and set the FREQSEL to 1 MHz.
        Sync prescale options of /2 and /4 can be paired with setting the osc to 2 or 4 MHz as well, with the same result
        Lowering count prescale dodges some bugs, and there isn't exactly a wealth of options. (it goes /4 to /32, nothing in the middle,
        and no undocumented fourth option (I checked :-P).
        But /32 will get you right on target (that being ~1 kHz) if CLK_OSCHF / Sync prescale = 8 MHz
        And /4 will get you right on target if CLK_OSCHF / Sync prescale = 1 MHz
        There are still more equivalent settings if you consider that there are more than one way to get to 1 MHz from the internal HF oscillator.
        Those settings are strictly worse if you aren't using the internal osc  for anything else.
        On the one hand, running with clock set to 1 MHz is probably more power efficient, though nothing using a crystal is going to set any records
        for power consumption - and using an external clock, well, you have the power consumption of the clock to worry about, which is often larger
        than the chip itself...
        On the other hand, using the /32 count prescaling exposes us to some silicon errata on the DA/DB - but in weirdo features nobody uses.
        On the third hand, if the crystal or clock is defective, and you were relying on overriding clock failure callbacks with your own functions
        that enable the internal oscillator at a known speed to communicate that to you (because you got a killer deal on crystals that have
        astonishingly high DOA rate or something?) If clock failure is a normal occurrence, you're doing something wrong...

        Anyway, regarding how we get the same frequency, well... very few Arduino folks care!
