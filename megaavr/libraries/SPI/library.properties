sentence=Enables the communication with devices that use the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Bus.
paragraph=SPI is a synchronous serial data protocol used by microcontrollers for communicating with one or more peripheral devices quickly over short distances. It uses three lines common to all devices (MISO, MOSI and SCK) and one specific for each device. This version has been modified, first to support pinswap on the megaAVR 0-series parts (by @MCUDude) and further by @SpenceKonde to do so on tinyAVR 0-series and 1-series for megaTinyCore, and later to ensure it plays nicely with SPI1, which supports the second SPI port on megaAVR 0-series and AVR-DA series parts, and with the new attachInterrupt code in 2.5.x. of megaTinyCore and 1.4.x of DxCore. 1.1.2 corrects a DxCore-specific typo and corrects styling of code in several places 1.1.1 corrects a further bug relating to startTransaction enabling slave mode and is distributed as part of megaTinyCore 2.5.12.  This version is distributed as part of megaTinyCore, see https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore for more information.
