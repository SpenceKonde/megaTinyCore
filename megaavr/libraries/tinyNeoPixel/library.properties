sentence=Arduino library for controlling single-wire-based LED pixels and strip for all modern (post 2016) AVR microcontrollers, and distributed with megaTinyCore and DxCore.
paragraph=This library is closely based on the original Adafruit_NeoPixel library. It has been modified to account for the improved ST performance on the tinyAVR 0-series, tinyAVR 1-series and megaAVR 0-series, and add support for speeds from 4 MHz to 48 MHz. No specific actions needed to choose the port the port at any speed (enabled by ST improvements). Please refer to the documentation for more information.<br>2.0.8 - make member variables protected, like they are on Adafruit version, alloweing richer subclassing.<br>2.0.7 - Fix critical defect in 10 and 12 MHz implementations which would output the first bit only.<br/> 2.0.6 - correct naming of labels in asm to conform with our naming policy. Add show(number), which will show up to the first (number) leds. This allows the static allocation version to light up a varying number of LEDs. 2.0.5 - correct some timing and compile issues at certain speeds. <br/> 2.0.4 - Add support for operation at speeds as low as 4 MHz. Ensure that the inline assembly is specified correctly. <br/>2.0.3 - Fix issue when millis is disabled.
