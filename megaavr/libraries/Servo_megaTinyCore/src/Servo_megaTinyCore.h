/*
  A servo is activated by creating an instance of the Servo class passing
  the desired pin to the attach() method.
  The servos are pulsed in the background using the value most recently
  written using the write() method.

  Note that analogWrite of PWM on pins associated with the timer are
  disabled when the first servo is attached.

  The methods are:

    Servo - Class for manipulating servo motors connected to Arduino pins.

    attach(pin)           - Attaches a servo motor to an i/o pin.
    attach(pin, min, max) - Attaches to a pin setting min and max values in microseconds
    default min is 544, max is 2400
    write()               - Sets the servo angle in degrees.  (invalid angle that is valid as pulse in microseconds is treated as microseconds)
    writeMicroseconds()   - Sets the servo pulse width in microseconds
    read()                - Gets the last written servo pulse width as an angle between 0 and 180.
    readMicroseconds()    - Gets the last written servo pulse width in microseconds. (was read_us() in first release)
    attached()            - Returns true if there is a servo attached.
    detach()              - Stops an attached servos from pulsing its i/o pin.


  This library supports 12 servos controlled by one timer.
  It does not recruit additional timers.

  Who the hell runs over a dozen servos from one board? Complain in the github
  issues for the core this was packaged with if this is actually a problem for you...
  I don't expect to hear from anyone. -Spence, Jan 2021
