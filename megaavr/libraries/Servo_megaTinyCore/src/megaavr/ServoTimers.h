//_timer is obviously used in Servo.cpp; and Servo.cpp works without explicitly telling the compiler this is used...
// it just generates a spurious warning, which is undesirable, all else being equal. What is really weird is that whether
//  it is marked used or not changes the size of the compiled binary by oh, a dozen or so bytes. The amount depends on the
// sketch, and not always in the same direction... but if you look at the generated assembly... there are differences
// all over the place! No observed differences in program behavior, though, so with the sketch size being a wash, err on
// the side of not getting a warning, especially a scary one like that (critically important variable considered unused).
