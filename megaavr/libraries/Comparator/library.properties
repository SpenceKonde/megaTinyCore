sentence=A library for interfacing with the built-in analog comparators.
paragraph=1.3.0 - add enclosing namespace to fix conflict with other @MCUDude libraries, move interrupt stuff to it's own file so if not used, it isn't included in the binary, both to save space and permit manually defined (hence more performant) interrupts. 1.2.0 - Harmonize with megaTinyCore, it is now compatible with all part families. Fix a few bugs, fix Interrupt example. Add getPeripheral(). 1.1.1 - add read(), output py inverted and non-inverted, external output no external output options. Eliminate pin direction stuff - AC periph has auto-direction when it takes over a pin (SK) 1.0.1 - fix DX compatibility issues, output bug (SK).
