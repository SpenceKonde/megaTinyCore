# Library Compatibility for megaTinyCore and DxCore
Please include information that uniquely identifies the library, as popular libraries have dozens of forks all over the internet, and it is often difficult to identify which is the "right one". Bonus points if you include a version number too - but I've given up on that.

## DxCore vs megaTinyCore
This page is linked to from the DxCore documentation as well, for the simple reason that the similarity of the underlying hardware is such that something that works with one will work with the other unless it's using specific features that are only present on one of the two (that is, it is a library for making use of a specific peripheral which was changed between those processors, which will always require library adjustment). It also, among other things, means that it is a recently written library with an author to complain to), or if it is very poorly written and checks for specific parts, rather than peripeheral types or things that are true for a whole host of parts (ie, testing for `#if defined(__ATtiny3216__) || defined(__ATtiny1614__)` - the two things the author tested on - when the exact same code might work on any modern AVR if they had instead tested `__AVR_ARCH__` - which picks up all modern AVRs with 64k of flash (102), 128k of flash (104) or 48k-or-less of flash (103 - the condition of `__AVR_ARCH__ == 103` is notable in that the flash is fully memory-mapped in these parts, and is not fully mapped for any other Arduino-compatible AVRs; Now that we have reverted the changes to the F() macro, I don't think there are any issues specific those. Particularly common is "special-casing" the ATmega4809 to pick up the Nano Every, and while the same code could have worked on every modern AVR (or was only a few trivial modifications away from that)

### A few plausible fault lines within the modern AVRs
Within the realm of modern AVRs (tinyAVR 0/1/2, megaAVR 0-series. Dx-series and Ex-series), there are only a limited number of plausible divding lines. Almost all of these only ever apply to stuff that interacts directly with a peripheral:
* Cases where a library's function is to interact with a specific peripheral not present on all parts will never work on parts without that peripheral.
* Things that directly manipulate the event system will have trouble on either tinyAVR 0/1-series or everything else. The event system on 0/1-series is different (and significantly worse) than that on all other modern AVRs (which differ from each other only in numbers of channels and the quantity of peripherals to act as users and generators). Hence, directly interacting with the event system and making it work everywhere core can be quite challenging. With 2.5.0 megaTinyCore and 1.4.0 DxCore we introduce a number of improvements to Event.h which make it much better as a basis for interacting with the event system in a device-independent way, though it still is far from perfect. In addition to all the wackiness of of the 0/1-series with two types of channels and generators having inconsistent numeric values on different channels, which isn't handled well, there are a few specific differences
  * tinyAVR 0/1-series and megaAVR 0-series only had 1 event input for TCA0. More recent parts have 2. Event.h has both `user::tca0_cnt_a` and `user::tca0` as synonyms to help paper over this. Use the new names when you have the option.
  * On tinyAVR 0/1-series and megaAVR 0-series, only TCA0 can count on event. On more recent parts, the TCBs can as well.
  * The EA series will break things again as they rework how pin and RTC PIT timer events are treated (but the benefit is that all event channels are equal).
  * This was the impetus for the Event.h library, and some of it's features: it was realized that a library for something as simple as input capture would have to be implemented once per part family!
* Things that manipulate the inner workings of the ADC will trip up, as each generation's ADC got subtle changes. tinyAVR 0/1 and megaAVR 0 are almost identical, Dx-series has 2 extra bits of resolution, and the option for (kind of) differential measurements, but it otherwise is similar. The 2-series and Ex-series have an all new much more capable ADC, which behaves quite differently. Any library is likely to require a totally separate implementation for the two sets of hardware.
* The tinyAVR 0/1-series PORTMUX registers are packed tighter (more peripherals per register in some cases) than elsewhere, and the names are different (and worse). The tinyAVR 2-series is Dx-like.
* The DD/EA-series have more options in their PORTMUX registers. I expect this pattern to be continued moving forward, with each generation
* Code written to interact with the RTC and developed on Dx-series or tinyAVR 2-series may not work on older parts. Except for the 32k 1-series parts if/until they release silicon with corrections to a number of serious silicon bugs relating to the RTC. Even basic operation requires use of (thankfully simple) workarounds. Those workarounds are nearly harmless if used the parts without the bug, so moving forward isn't generally a problem
* Code that manipulates the system clock controller may pose challenges. As far as I can tell, it looks like the tinyAVR 0/1/2-series and megaAVR 0-series got one version of `CLKCTRL`, The AVR DA-series got another, the DB and DD got a third, and the EA-series is going to get a mashup of the tinyAVR and Dx-series ones.
* Direct port manipulation counts as working with a peripheral (the PORT peripheral has it's own chapter, doesn't it?). All Dx-series parts get the multipin configuration for for setting PINnCTRL *on masse* and the DB, DD, and EA series have a TTL input level option, so you can tell them to have definitions of HIGH and LOW that don't depend on supply voltage with per-pin granularity. Library authors who attempt to use those features should respectively, check for `PORTA_PINCONTROL` or `PORT_INLVL_bm` being defined and provide an implementation that does not make use of it and optionally add a #warning to inform the user if this degrades functionality, or #error if the library is not viable without it.

## Pre-compiled libraries
As of megaTinyCore 2.4.0/DxCore 1.3.x, pre-compiled libraries (ie, those distributed as .a files instead of source) can be used. These sort of libraries have several significant disadvantages. First and foremost, the library must include a compiled .a file for the specific part being used. The libraries are typically distributed without source code, so you cannot generate those files for the device you want to use if not included. . This is also the primary motivation for such libraries - to allow authors to distribute a library without letting anyone see their code, which may be licensed under proprietary terms. The libraries also trade off compile speed for binary size - but in the wrong direction: Compile speed increases because the library doesn't need to be compiled, but lacking the symbols normally left for the link-time optimizer, the linker cannot make it as small as it could if compiling from source. Finally, because the code is not available, you must rely upon the documentation provided by the library creator(s) - you don't have the source code as documentation of last resort; the commercial entities who adore proprietary licenses are far from immune to bad documentation. In fact, there is no clear association between the two - while putting a skilled technical writer between the library author and the library user can result in much better documentation - but  an unskilled one can turn the developers' poorly written but accurate notes (which likely also make optimistic assumptions about the background of the reader) into a mass of impenetrable yet grammatically correct verbiage lacking in clarity, relevance and accuracy. Often the technical writer falls short on the technical background, is unclear on the motivation or use case for a feature, and .

For these reasons, although they are supported, pre-compiled libraries are not recommended where alternatives are available. Often, when all you can get are precompiled libraries you will discover that they won't be compiled for the parts you want them for, or were built with AVR as an afterthought, having been ported by someone who was inexperienced with the architecture and who looks down upon  hpeople are  unaware of it's limitations or of relevant market trends and generally ill-prepared to meet the challenge.  A great example of dreams crushed by pre-compiled proprietary libraries is the BME680 library. Anyone can get the raw readings out no problem. But you wanted the IAQ number? Oh, you need their library for that. Supplied pre-compiled, mind-blowingly bloated, and only supporting the ATmega2560 on AVR (they think you should be using an ARM, I guess). So nobody can use it with any recent part, even though Dx-series could fit it, much less figure out how they managed to make it generate a binary larger than the side of a house when it is taking a handful of numbers and turning them into a single calculated values. (my impression looking through the disassembly listings, is that they defaulted floating point values for everything, and are unfamiliar with AVR as a platform and it's limitations. It was clear that it would be a major undertaking to reverse engineer the IAQ calculation (though the code isn't obfuscated as far as I could tell, it was just assembly provided without comments or context. , reading unadorned assembly is very difficult and timecosuming).
